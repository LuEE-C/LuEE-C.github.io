PhD Student at MILA and Polytechnique Montr√©al working in NLP. In the last two years, with the advent of NLP models such as BERT, several new possibilities have emerged. Zero-shot QA, using language model as knowledge bases and general knowledge representation seems up for grabs. Old assumptions of what can and cannot work needs to be challenged and I aim to do just that.


While I focus on NLP for my research, I have an interest and experience in a wide variety of Machine Learning and Deep Learning subjects, reinforcement learning, meta-learning, generative models and data science competition to name a few. [My Github](https://github.com/luee-c) and [my Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/octthe16th).
